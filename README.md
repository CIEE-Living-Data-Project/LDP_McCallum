## Scripts and data for Living Data Project course

I am using this repository to download files from a url to complete my mock-up project for the Living Data Project course * *Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution* *. 

The project utilizes data from Grasslands National Park.  My project is focused on Greater Sage-Grouse abundance at lek sites within the park and surrounding areas.
