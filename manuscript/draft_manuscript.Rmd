abstract: |
  Grasslands National Park in southern Saskatchewan has a population of greater sage grouse. Each spring, the male greater sage grouse congregate in groups at known locations to lek. These lek sites were monitored from 2007-2020 and the abundance of male birds was counted at each site. I am graphically illustrating the abundance trends over the years for each lek site.

## Introduction:

Male greater sage grouse congregate during the breeding season to lek [@knick2013].

## Methods:

Grasslands National Park staff observed lek sites during the breeding season from 2005-2020. The maximum number of male birds at a lek site at one time was termed peak male attendance and this was recorded for each lek site. Using the ggplot2 package in R, I am graphically representing the variation in abundance between lek sites over the 15 years of observations.
